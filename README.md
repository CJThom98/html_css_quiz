# User Story

AS A coding boot camp student <br/>
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores <br/>
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers <br/>

# What Was Done
- Decided to create a Jeopardy style quiz with a holiday theme
- Utilized different bootstrap format methods such as grid and text formats
- Learned how to develop modals, even surprising my TA by how early I learned them

# What I Wasn't Able To Do
 - I became a too ambitious with my Jeopardy project that I devoted too much time to getting it to work like a Jeopardy board
 - I wasn't able to make the score tracker or timer, the best I was able to do was create an indicator for when the user selected the correct answer or not
 - Taking the modal approach perhaps also complicated things as even my TA was having trouble trying to help me
 - In hind sight, I should've stuck with a more simple approach since I was pressed for time
 - Realized the hard way that unique and creative designs should be done when there's enough time
